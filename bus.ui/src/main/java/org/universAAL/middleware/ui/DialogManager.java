/**
 * Dialog Manager is the main (application-independent) component for handling
 * system dialogs. It (1) represents the whole system by providing system menus
 * (a unified view of all services available), possibilities to search for
 * specific services, and by handling context-free user input (user input that
 * cannot be assigned to any running dialog), and (2) assists the I/O buses by
 * (2.1) acting as a representative for the whole framework supporting
 * context-awareness & personalization, and by (2.2) providing user-specific
 * management of dialogs initiated by different applications to protect the user
 * against a mess of parallel dialogs (decides whether some dialog needs to wait
 * for another dialog to finish).
 * 
 * This interface is supposed to be implemented by exactly one component. The
 * first component that registers as an output publisher to the output bus (and
 * implements this interface) blocks the registration of any further
 * implementation of this interface.
