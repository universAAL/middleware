/**

 * reach human users (in order to present information to them and / or ask them
 * for intervention) and the so-called UI handlers that can handle the
 * interaction with human users through I/O channels under their control. This
 * bus is a call-based bus without any support for synchronized delivery of
 * replies (replies will always be delivered in a new thread). It defines
 * protocols for suspending and resuming dialogs, dynamic adaptation of
 * "rendering" by a previously selected UI handler during the dialog is running,
 * and transfer of responsibility to another UI handler. It accepts registration
 * parameters from UI handlers (when they register to the bus) and allows
 * removing and/or updating of these parameters.
